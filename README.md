    ### Technology Stack
    **Django :** A high-level Python web framework used for rapid API development with built-in admin, ORM, and authentication support.

    **GraphQL  :** A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving performance and flexibility.

    **PostgreSQL / MySQL (alternative to MongoDB) :** Relational databases used for structured data storage when complex queries and relationships are needed (e.g., bookings, payments, users).

    **Sequelize / SQLAlchemy (if using PostgreSQL/MySQL) :** ORMs (Object Relational Mappers) used to interact with relational databases using JavaScript/Python objects.

    **JWT (JSON Web Token) :** Used for secure stateless authentication between the client and server.

    **Passport.js / Django REST Framework Auth :** Libraries used to implement authentication strategies such as local login, Google OAuth, etc.

    **Docker :** Used for containerizing the backend application for consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.

    **Git / GitHub :** For version control, collaboration, and continuous integration workflows.

### Feature Breakdown
This section describes the core features of the Airbnb clone booking management system. Each feature has been designed to support both user interaction and administrative functionality on the platform.

1. User Management
Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. This feature ensures secure access for guests and hosts, allowing them to manage their personal information and activity on the platform.

2. Property Management
Enables hosts to list, update, and remove rental properties. Guests can browse, search, and filter available listings based on location, price, availability, and other criteria.

3. Booking System
Allows users to reserve properties for specific dates and manage their bookings (e.g., cancel or modify). This system tracks availability and prevents double bookings, ensuring smooth transaction flow.

4. Review & Rating System
Lets guests leave feedback and star ratings for properties they've stayed in. This builds trust within the community and helps future guests make informed decisions.

5. Payment Processing
Supports secure payment handling for confirmed bookings. Integrates with payment gateways to manage transactions and track payment statuses such as completed, pending, or failed.

6. Search & Filtering
Provides advanced search capabilities including filters like location, price range, number of guests, amenities, and availability. Enhances the user experience by helping users find the perfect listing quickly.

7. Notifications & Messaging
Facilitates communication between hosts and guests through an integrated messaging system and sends real-time notifications for booking confirmations, cancellations, and updates.


### API Security
Security is a top priority for the Airbnb Clone Project, especially since the system handles sensitive user data, financial transactions, and personal communications. The following security measures are implemented to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the application.

#### Key Security Measures
**Authentication (JWT / OAuth)**
Users must log in using secure tokens (JWT) or third-party authentication (e.g., Google OAuth). Tokens are used to verify identity across requests.

**Authorization**
Role-based access control ensures users can only perform actions they're allowed to (e.g., only hosts can edit properties).

**HTTPS Encryption**
All API communication is encrypted using HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Rate Limiting**
Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests a user or IP can make within a certain timeframe.

**Input Validation**
All incoming data is validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

**Password Hashing**
User passwords are securely hashed using algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 before being stored in the database.

**Secure Payment Handling**
Payment information is not stored directly; instead, trusted third-party services (like Stripe) are used to handle transactions securely.

#### Why Security Matters in Each Area
**User Data Protection :**
Personal details like email addresses, phone numbers, and payment methods must be kept private. Strong authentication and encryption help protect against data leaks and unauthorized access.

**Property & Booking Management :**
Hosts and guests interact with listings and bookings frequently. Authorization ensures only the rightful owners can modify their data, preventing fraud or tampering.

**Payment Transactions :**
Financial data must be handled with extreme care. Using tokenized payments and avoiding direct storage of card details minimizes risk and complies with PCI-DSS standards.

**Search & Messaging Features :**
While less sensitive, these features still need protection from spam, abuse, and unauthorized usage. Rate limiting and input validation help maintain system stability and user trust.

**Notifications & Communication :**
Ensuring messages between users are sent securely and cannot be intercepted helps maintain privacy and platform credibility.

### CI/CD Pipeline
A CI/CD pipeline automates the process of testing, building, and deploying applications. CI (Continuous Integration) ensures that code changes from multiple contributors are automatically tested and merged into a shared repository, while CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery) automates the release of these changes to production or staging environments.

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline is essential for maintaining code quality, catching bugs early, ensuring consistent deployments, and enabling faster iterations as the project grows.

#### Tools Used
**GitHub Actions**
Automates workflows for building, testing, and deploying the application directly from the GitHub repository.

**Docker**
Packages the backend and frontend applications into containers to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

**Linters & Test Runners (ESLint, Jest, etc.)**
Ensures code quality and runs automated tests on every push or pull request.
